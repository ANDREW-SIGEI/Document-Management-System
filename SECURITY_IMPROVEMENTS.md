# Security Improvements for KEMRI Laboratory System

## Current Security Status

The current implementation has the following security limitations:
- Plain text password storage in the database
- Basic authentication with no protection against brute force attacks
- No HTTPS implementation for secure data transmission
- Limited input validation and sanitization
- No session timeout mechanism
- No audit logging for security-related events

## Recommended Security Improvements

### 1. Password Security

- **Implement Password Hashing**: 
  ```python
  from werkzeug.security import generate_password_hash, check_password_hash
  
  # In User model
  def set_password(self, password):
      self.password = generate_password_hash(password)
      
  def check_password(self, password):
      return check_password_hash(self.password, password)
  ```

- **Password Policy Enforcement**:
  - Minimum length (8+ characters)
  - Complexity requirements (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special characters)
  - Password expiration
  - Password history to prevent reuse

### 2. Authentication Improvements

- **Implement Two-Factor Authentication**:
  - SMS or email verification codes
  - Time-based one-time passwords (TOTP)
  
- **Brute Force Protection**:
  - Account lockout after multiple failed attempts
  - Progressive delays between login attempts
  - IP-based rate limiting

### 3. Transport Layer Security

- **HTTPS Implementation**:
  - Obtain SSL/TLS certificate (Let's Encrypt)
  - Configure web server for HTTPS
  - Implement HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)
  - Redirect HTTP to HTTPS

### 4. Input Validation and Sanitization

- **Form Validation**:
  - Server-side validation for all inputs
  - Parameterized queries for all database interactions
  - Content Security Policy (CSP) implementation

- **File Upload Security**:
  - Validate file types and content
  - Scan for malware
  - Store files outside web root

### 5. Session Management

- **Secure Session Implementation**:
  - Implement session timeout (30 minutes of inactivity)
  - Secure session cookies (HttpOnly, Secure flags)
  - Session regeneration on privilege changes
  
- **Logout Functionality**:
  - Proper session termination
  - Force logout on suspicious activities

### 6. Access Control

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**:
  - Clearly defined permissions per role
  - Principle of least privilege
  - Regular access reviews
  
- **IP Restrictions**:
  - Restrict administrative access to trusted IP ranges
  - Geolocation-based access controls

### 7. Audit and Monitoring

- **Security Logging**:
  - Log all authentication attempts (successful and failed)
  - Log all privileged actions
  - Log security-relevant system events
  
- **Alerting System**:
  - Notify administrators of suspicious activities
  - Real-time monitoring of security events

### 8. API Security

- **API Authentication**:
  - Implement token-based authentication (JWT)
  - API rate limiting
  - API scope restrictions

### 9. Data Protection

- **Database Encryption**:
  - Encrypt sensitive data at rest
  - Implement proper key management
  
- **Data Minimization**:
  - Store only necessary data
  - Implement data retention policies

## Implementation Priority

1. **High Priority (Immediate)**:
   - Password hashing implementation
   - HTTPS configuration
   - Basic input validation

2. **Medium Priority (Next Phase)**:
   - Two-factor authentication
   - Brute force protection
   - Session management improvements

3. **Future Enhancements**:
   - Advanced logging and monitoring
   - Database encryption
   - Geo-based restrictions

## Security Governance

- Conduct regular security assessments
- Implement a vulnerability disclosure program
- Establish a security incident response plan
- Regular security training for administrators

By implementing these security improvements, the KEMRI Laboratory System will significantly enhance its security posture and better protect sensitive laboratory data.
